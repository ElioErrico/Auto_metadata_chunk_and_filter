    "description": "This plugin automatically classifies and filters documents using metadata. It concatenates chunks of content based on settings, analyzes them to assign metadata from 'list_of_tags.json' (which you can edit), and uploads each chunk with its metadata. If it can't find suitable metadata, it generates a new one. You can also manually input metadata to bypass automatic classification. Usage involves editing 'list_of_tags.json' with relevant keywords, uploading the document, and enabling the plugin to classify or directly inputting metadata as needed.",
